Board Formatting
====
Boards must be formatted as such:

1) First line is <# of columns> <# of rows>, separated by spaces.

2) Starting from the top row, type out letters of the actual game board, with each row separated by a nextline.

3) Capitalize each letter you have access to. This means your base will be entirely capitalized.

Sample board:
````
10 13
hiotyerhoc
lemhviluru
irsguqagio
txilnrlizs
aeloesated
nstkdtiain
yneiasnevu
srntltIhrl
EcArocoasi
oTIleucfdk
uVsctpdmlc
DANeiseaiu
CUJGXUWBEP
````

In the above sample board, the user's base is at the bottom, and is player blue. Letters the user has access to, outside of the base, are D, A, N, V, T, I, E, A.

Capitalized letters must be updated with each round of moves.
